# Pro-Flash

This is a flashcard application designed for studying various topics related to programming concepts as well as the ability to create your own cards and save them to your own browsers local storage.

This project was assigned as a solo project over a period of 4 days, as a way to solidify basic React concepts as well as study for an upcoming final (which worked very well I might add)
